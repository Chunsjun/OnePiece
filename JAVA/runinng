Running your Java Programmes


 

When you run a programme in NetBeans, it will run in the Output window at the bottom of your screen, just underneath your code. This is so that you don't have to start a terminal or console window - the Output window IS the console.

There are various ways to run your programme in NetBeans. The easiest way is to press F6 on your Keyboard. You can also run programmes using the menus as the top of NetBeans. Locate the Run menu, then select Run Project (Project Name):

You can also click the green arrow on the NetBeans toolbar:

The Run icon on the toolbar

Another way to run your programmes is from the Projects window. This will ensure that the right source code is being run. Simply right click your java source file in the projects window and you'll see a menu appear. Select Run File. (We've chopped off some of the menu items. Yours will be longer.)

Running the programme from the Projects window

Another way to run the code is to right click inside of the code area. In the image below, we've right-clicked just before the final curly bracket (again, we've chopped off some menu items):

Using one of the above methods, run your programme. You should see something happening in the Output window:

The second line in the Output window above is our code: My First Project. You can quickly run it again by clicking the two green arrows in the top left of the Output window.

In the next lesson, you'll learn how to share your programs with others.
