Random Number Functions
Random numbers are used for games, simulations, testing, security, and privacy applications. Python includes following functions that are commonly used.

Function	Description
choice(seq)

A random item from a list, tuple, or string.
randrange ([start,] stop [,step])

A randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)
random()

A random float r, such that 0 is less than or equal to r and r is less than 1
seed([x])

Sets the integer starting value used in generating random numbers. Call this function before calling any other random module function. Returns None.
shuffle(lst)

Randomizes the items of a list in place. Returns None.
uniform(x, y)

A random float r, such that x is less than or equal to r and r is less than y
Trigonometric Functions
Python includes following functions that perform trigonometric calculations.

Function	Description
acos(x)

Return the arc cosine of x, in radians.
asin(x)

Return the arc sine of x, in radians.
atan(x)

Return the arc tangent of x, in radians.
atan2(y, x)

Return atan(y / x), in radians.
cos(x)

Return the cosine of x radians.
hypot(x, y)

Return the Euclidean norm, sqrt(x*x + y*y).
sin(x)

Return the sine of x radians.
tan(x)

Return the tangent of x radians.
degrees(x)

Converts angle x from radians to degrees.
radians(x)

Converts angle x from degrees to radians.
