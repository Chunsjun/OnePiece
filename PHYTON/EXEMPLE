Examples
Here are some examples of numbers

int	long	float	complex
10	51924361L	0.0	3.14j
100	-0x19323L	15.20	45.j
-786	0122L	-21.9	9.322e-36j
080	0xDEFABCECBDAECBFBAEL	32.3+e18	.876j
-0490	535633629843L	-90.	-.6545+0J
-0x260	-052318172735L	-32.54e100	3e+26J
0x69	-4721885298529L	70.2-E12	4.53e-7j
Python allows you to use a lowercase L with long, but it is recommended that you use only an uppercase L to avoid confusion with the number 1. Python displays long integers with an uppercase L.

A complex number consists of an ordered pair of real floating point numbers denoted by a + bj, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part of the complex number.

Number Type Conversion
Python converts numbers internally in an expression containing mixed types to a common type for evaluation. But sometimes, you need to coerce a number explicitly from one type to another to satisfy the requirements of an operator or function parameter.

Type int(x) to convert x to a plain integer.

Type long(x) to convert x to a long integer.

Type float(x) to convert x to a floating-point number.

Type complex(x) to convert x to a complex number with real part x and imaginary part zero.

Type complex(x, y) to convert x and y to a complex number with real part x and imaginary part y. x and y are numeric expressions

Mathematical Functions
Python includes following functions that perform mathematical calculations.

Function	Returns ( description )
abs(x)

The absolute value of x: the (positive) distance between x and zero.
ceil(x)

The ceiling of x: the smallest integer not less than x
cmp(x, y)

-1 if x < y, 0 if x == y, or 1 if x > y
exp(x)

The exponential of x: ex
fabs(x)

The absolute value of x.
floor(x)

The floor of x: the largest integer not greater than x
log(x)

The natural logarithm of x, for x> 0
log10(x)

The base-10 logarithm of x for x> 0 .
max(x1, x2,...)

The largest of its arguments: the value closest to positive infinity
min(x1, x2,...)

The smallest of its arguments: the value closest to negative infinity
modf(x)

The fractional and integer parts of x in a two-item tuple. Both parts have the same sign as x. The integer part is returned as a float.
pow(x, y)

The value of x**y.
round(x [,n])

x rounded to n digits from the decimal point. Python rounds away from zero as a tie-breaker: round(0.5) is 1.0 and round(-0.5) is -1.0.
sqrt(x)

The square root of x for x > 0
Random Number Functions
Random numbers are used for games, simulations, testing, security, and privacy applications. Python includes following functions that are commonly used.

Function	Description
choice(seq)

A random item from a list, tuple, or string.
randrange ([start,] stop [,step])

A randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)
random()

A random float r, such that 0 is less than or equal to r and r is less than 1
seed([x])

Sets the integer starting value used in generating random numbers. Call this function before calling any other random module function. Returns None.
shuffle(lst)

Randomizes the items of a list in place. Returns None.
uniform(x, y)

A random float r, such that x is less than or equal to r and r is less than y
Trigonometric Functions
Python includes following functions that perform trigonometric calculations.

Function	Description
acos(x)

Return the arc cosine of x, in radians.
asin(x)

Return the arc sine of x, in radians.
atan(x)

Return the arc tangent of x, in radians.
atan2(y, x)

Return atan(y / x), in radians.
cos(x)

Return the cosine of x radians.
hypot(x, y)

Return the Euclidean norm, sqrt(x*x + y*y).
sin(x)

Return the sine of x radians.
tan(x)

Return the tangent of x radians.
degrees(x)

Converts angle x from radians to degrees.
radians(x)

Converts angle x from degrees to radians.
Mathematical Constants
The module also defines two mathematical constants âˆ’

Constants	Description
pi	The mathematical constant pi.
e	The mathematical constant e.
