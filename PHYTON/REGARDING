Makefile
Location	./Makefile
Purpose	Generic management tasks.
If you look at most of my projects or any Pocoo project, you’ll notice a Makefile laying around. Why? These projects aren’t written in C... In short, make is a incredibly useful tool for defining generic tasks for your project.

Sample Makefile:

init:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

test:
    py.test tests

.PHONY: init test
Other generic management scripts (e.g. manage.py or fabfile.py) belong at the root of the repository as well.
