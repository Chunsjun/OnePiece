Types of Operator
Python language supports the following types of operators.

Arithmetic Operators

Comparison (Relational) Operators

Assignment Operators

Logical Operators

Bitwise Operators

Membership Operators

Identity Operators

Let us have a look on all operators one by one.

Python Arithmetic Operators
Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20, then −

[ Show Example ]

Operator	Description	Example
+ Addition	Adds values on either side of the operator.	a + b = 30
- Subtraction	Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.	a – b = -10
* Multiplication	Multiplies values on either side of the operator	a * b = 200
/ Division	Divides left hand operand by right hand operand	b / a = 2
% Modulus	Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder	b % a = 0
** Exponent	Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators	a**b =10 to the power 20
//	Floor Division - The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are removed. But if one of the operands is negative, the result is floored, i.e., rounded away from zero (towards negative infinity):	9//2 = 4 and 9.0//2.0 = 4.0, -11//3 = -4, -11.0
