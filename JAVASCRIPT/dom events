HTML DOM allows JavaScript to react to HTML events:

Reacting to Events
A JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element.

To execute code when a user clicks on an element, add JavaScript code to an HTML event attribute:

onclick=JavaScript
Examples of HTML events:

When a user clicks the mouse
When a web page has loaded
When an image has been loaded
When the mouse moves over an element
When an input field is changed
When an HTML form is submitted
When a user strokes a key
In this example, the content of the <h1> element is changed when a user clicks on it:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 onclick="this.innerHTML='Ooops!'">Click on this text!</h1>

</body>
</html>

In this example, a function is called from the event handler:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 onclick="changeText(this)">Click on this text!</h1>

<script>
function changeText(id) { 
    id.innerHTML = "Ooops!";
}
</script>

</body>
</html>

In the example above, a function named displayDate is assigned to an HTML element with the id="myBtn".

The function will be executed when the button is clicked.

The onload and onunload Events
The onload and onunload events are triggered when the user enters or leaves the page.

The onload event can be used to check the visitor's browser type and browser version, and load the proper version of the web page based on the information.

The onload and onunload events can be used to deal with cookies.

Example
<body onload="checkCookies()">
