JavaScript HTML DOM - Changing CSS
❮ PreviousNext ❯
The HTML DOM allows JavaScript to change the style of HTML elements.

Changing HTML Style
To change the style of an HTML element, use this syntax:

document.getElementById(id).style.property=new style
The following example changes the style of a <p> element:

Example
<html>
<body>

<p id="p2">Hello World!</p>

<script>
document.getElementById("p2").style.color = "blue";
</script>

<p>The paragraph above was changed by a script.</p>

</body>
</html>

Using Events
The HTML DOM allows you to execute code when an event occurs.

Events are generated by the browser when "things happen" to HTML elements:

An element is clicked on
The page has loaded
Input fields are changed
You will learn more about events in the next chapter of this tutorial.

This example changes the style of the HTML element with id="id1", when the user clicks a button:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 id="id1">My Heading 1</h1>

<button type="button" 
onclick="document.getElementById('id1').style.color = 'red'">
Click Me!</button>

</body>
</html>
