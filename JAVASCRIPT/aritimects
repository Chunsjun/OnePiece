JavaScript Arithmetic

A typical thing to do with numbers is arithmetic.

JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables).

Operator	Description
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
/	Division
%	Modulus
++	Increment
--	Decrement
Arithmetic Operations
A typical arithmetic operation operates on two numbers.

The two numbers can be literals:

Example
var x = 100 + 50;

or variables:

Example
var x = a + b;
Try it Yourself »
or expressions:

Example
var x = (100 + 50) * a;

Operators and Operands
The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.

The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.

Operand	Operator	Operand
100	+	50
The addition operator (+) adds numbers:

Adding
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x + y;

The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers.

Subtracting
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x - y;
Try it Yourself »
The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.

Multiplying
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x * y;
Try it Yourself »
The division operator (/) divides numbers.

Dividing
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x / y;
Try it Yourself »
The modular operator (%) returns the division remainder.

Modulus
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x % y;

The increment operator (++) increments numbers.

Incrementing
var x = 5;
x++;
var z = x;
Try it Yourself »
The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers.

Decrementing
var x = 5;
x--;
var z = x;

Operator Precedence
Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.

Example
var x = 100 + 50 * 3;
Try it Yourself »
Is the result of example above the same as 150 * 3, or is it the same as 100 + 150?

Is the addition or the multiplication done first?

As in traditional school mathematics, the multiplication is done first.

Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).

And (as in school mathematics) the precedence can be changed by using parentheses:

Example
var x = (100 + 50) * 3;
Try it Yourself »
When using parentheses, the operations inside the parentheses are computed first.

When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction), they are computed from left to right:

Example
var x = 100 + 50 - 3;
