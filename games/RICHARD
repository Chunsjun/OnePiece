 Callum Paterson
Hearts came from two goals down to equalise through Callum Paterson
Callum Paterson's late goal completed Hearts' comeback as they recovered from two goals down to earn a point against Hamilton at New Douglas Park.

Jamie Walker fired Hearts ahead after Bjorn Johnsen's cross was not cleared.

But Ali Crawford's sublime free-kick drew Accies level, before Rakish Bingham scored twice after half-time; his second a thunderous shot.

Walker reduced the deficit with a penalty after Dan Seaborne clipped Don Cowie, then Paterson stabbed home.

At 3-1 up Hamilton were heading for sixth place but could only end the evening one point above bottom side Dundee.

Hearts stay fourth, now three points behind Rangers.

Crawford class

In their moment of greatest need, Hamilton could rely on a familiar source of hope. Crawford, a slight figure but an imposing talent, prompted, cajoled and helped to wrench this game back into the home side's command.

As they chased an equaliser in the first half, it was Crawford who delivered the decisive touch, sweeping a free-kick from 20 yards into the bottom corner of the net, just out of the reach of Hearts goalkeeper Jack Hamilton.

The game was frantic and untidy at times, particularly in the first half, but Crawford was seldom anything other than composed and sprightly in midfield. There can be a spikiness to him, and he shared some angry words with Hearts players in the second half, but most prominent was his talent.

He almost created a fourth goal, as well, when his cross to Gramoz Kurtaj saw the striker steer his header just wide.

Hearts match up

The visitors lined-up in a 3-5-2 shape that mirrored the Hamilton formation. That allowed them to match up man-to-man, but it also demanded moments of accommodation.

Sloppiness was evident in both sides, but Hearts had more cause to curse their waywardness. They had an early warning, when John Souttar got in a tangle with Walker, but had the presence of mind to rush back to the goal-line and be in the right place at the right time to block Bingham's header.

It was a problem at the other end, too, with Johnsen slow to react after a Georgios Sarris back pass left him clean through on goal. Even so, once Hearts found their feet, they carried a threat.

They led from early on, thanks to Walker's excellent first-time half-volley, and the attacker - who was playing as a wing-back - confidently tucked away the second-half penalty awarded after Seaborne cleared from Cowie, but was adjudged to have fouled him.

As they chased the game, Hearts were able to count on the scoring prowess of Paterson, who surged up-field from centre-back to calmly finish from inside the area.

Bingham delivers

Hamilton have struggled for goals all season - they went into this game as the joint bottom scorers in the Premiership - but they built a two-goal lead in the second half thanks to some deft finishing by Bingham.

The striker reacted calmly after some crisp passing just seconds after the interval sent him through on goal, and he slotted the ball past the goalkeeper.

His second finish was more emphatic, as he rifled a shot on the angle across Hamilton and into the far corner after good play by Kurtaj.

There was no opportunity for a hat-trick, and he would have sighed with relief when Walker saw his chance of a treble thwarted by the post when he curled in a shot from 25 yards out.
