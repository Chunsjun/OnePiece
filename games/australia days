Australia Day: Fremantle banned from citizenship ceremonies

Australia Day is referred to as "invasion day" by some indigenous Australians
A Western Australian city will not be allowed to hold citizenship ceremonies on its alternative national day.
Fremantle council last month decided to move traditional Australia Day events from 26 to 28 January because of Aboriginal cultural sensitivities.
A "culturally inclusive alternative" is now due to be held on 28 January out of respect for the Indigenous community.
But authorities say holding citizenship ceremonies on that date would send an anti-Australia Day message.
"Citizenship has got to be apolitical, non-commercial, bipartisan and secular," Assistant Immigration Minister Alex Hawke told ABC radio.
"It's really important... we've got hundreds of councils administering this around the country... that they don't get the idea they can use citizenship as a political football."
The Australia Day public holiday is traditionally held on 26 January across the country, marking the arrival of Britain's First Fleet on 26 January 1788.
Fremantle council voted in August to scrap its popular Australia Day fireworks event from 2017 after deeming the celebration "culturally insensitive".
Fremantle mayor Brad Pettitt was subsequently accused on social media of grandstanding, being politically correct and not seeking the advice of Aboriginal leaders.
To quash rumours local indigenous elder Robert Eggington last week posted a photo of dozens of elders meeting with the council in September, saying the decision was 50 years ahead of its time.
"It's a clarification of history, because celebrating the day the first gunshots ploughed our blood into the earth is horrific for Aboriginal people," he wrote.
"I believe Brad Pettitt will become a historic figure because of the decision."
